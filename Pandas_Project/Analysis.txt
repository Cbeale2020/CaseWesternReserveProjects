Data collected by Heroes of Pymoli, there were three significant observations I can make.

	This game is gravitated toward the male demographic, 62% of the total plays were males so Heroes of Pymoli marketing strategy should plan accordingly. Besides gender, it's also important to note that most of the individuals were in there early to late twenty's, 51%, so maybe post college students, early workforce. Ages 10-19 came in second with 34%.

	With 576 players who made item purchases in the game, here's a list of the Top Spenders:
Lisosia9 
Idastidru52
Chamjask73
Iral74 
Iskadarya95

These individuals should be rewarded somehow, if they are willing to spend the most, your company might want to retain them as loyal customers.

	I noticed that 'Final Critic' was purchased the most, which is awesome, however, we should try to sell more of our top 5 highest priced Items, like Stormfury Mace, Mercy, Katana of Dismay, Stormfury Longsword, Hellreaver, Heirloom of Inception or Blazeguard, Reach of Eternity.
